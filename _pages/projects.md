The theme of the residency will be "community privacy," i.e. privacy and cryptography tools that protect and empower communities from the ground up. Community privacy means creating safe spaces for vulnerable communities to live, share, organize, and interact with those outside their community.

Below are proposed project tracks and example project ideas under community privacy that the organizers have put together and will present to residency participants. We also expect some flexibility and potential for new tracks relevant to these themes to emerge throughout the residency.

### Community Applications for Vulnerable Groups

- Updating [Callisto Vault](https://www.projectcallisto.org/callistovault) with zkEmail, MP-FHE
- Privacy-preserving payments for people in professions where privacy is a matter of personal safety
- Privacy-preserving coordination tools, e.g. MPC/MP-FHE for unions and labor organizers
- Privacy-preserving reporting tools, e.g. for reporting abuse, whistleblowing

### Community Co-Design

- Facilitating participatory co-design sessions
- Interface design and mockups for consent interfaces
- Threat modeling
    - Overview of frameworks, e.g.:
        - [Invariant-Centric Threat Modelling](https://github.com/defuse/ictm)
        - "[On Privacy Notions in Secure Communication](https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/notions-pets2019.pdf)"
- Participatory co-design for collective data governance interfaces
- Cryptography-backed consent: Collective consent mechanisms, co-design for consent mechanisms

### Privacy Infrastructure

- [MPCStats or MP-FHE statistics library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6DiFdMV6auFvXDAMeA-SKcZK21JiSl0fgUOveN2UKM/edit?usp=sharing), data analysis on sensitive information for vulnerable communities
- Integrations with Polis and verifiable ID - private messaging boards, private majority reports, hierarchy of opinions (e.g. concept of expert analyses)

## Expected Outputs

In addition to building community and organizing events for privacy, cryptography, and community organizing, several deliverable outcomes from the residency include:

- **Open-source technical prototypes** and proofs-of-concept of privacy-preserving tools and community-focused applications
- **Original research** and writing, e.g. blog posts, whitepapers, reports
- Development of **educational resources** and guides, e.g. publications or public-facing workshops
- **Participatory co-design workshops**, including write-ups of learnings and takeaways, and process documentation

Sharing of outputs would include:

- Sharing sessions and **workshares** from residents and local Taipei communities
- **Demo day** on the last day
- **Written publication** collating outputs: progress reports, new projects, publications, documentation, etc.
