title: "Mitan (密谈): Anonymous reporting using fully homomorphic encryption"
nav: false

**Project description:**
Mitan is a proof of concept app that matches reports with shared concerns completely privately. It’s implemented by finding the similarity score between word embeddings from multiple parties by computing a dot product using fully homomorphic encryption.

**Artifacts:**

- Slides: [Mitan presentation](https://github.com/emmaguo13/phantom-zone/tree/emma/pnns)
- [Github (FHE code)](https://github.com/emmaguo13/phantom-zone/tree/emma/pnns)
- [Github (in progress app)](https://github.com/emmaguo13/fhe-workplace)
