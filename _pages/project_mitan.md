title: "Mitan (密谈): Anonymous reporting using fully homomorphic encryption"

**Project description:**
Mitan is a proof of concept app that matches reports with shared concerns completely privately. It’s implemented by finding the similarity score between word embeddings from multiple parties by computing a dot product using fully homomorphic encryption.

**Artifacts:**
