Our organizing team has compiled a non-exhaustive list of relevant resources. We hope these can be useful both for brainstorming project ideas as well as general learning.

### Co-Design

- [Design from the Margins: Centering the Most Marginalized and Impacted in Design Processes—from Ideation to Production](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/design-margins)
- [Introduction to community-led co-design](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/introduction/)
- [Community Co-Design Tools and Tactics: An approach to equitable community engagement and action](https://dmc.mn/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Community_CoDesign_Booklet.pdf)

### Community Needs

- [Engineering privacy for vulnerable populations](https://recapworkshop.online/recap24/contributions/troncoso-privacy-vulnerable-populations.html)
- [Toward Safer Intimate Futures: Recommendations for Tech Platforms to Reduce Image Based Sexual Abuse](https://www.eswalliance.org/toward_safer_intimate_futures_recommendations_tech_platforms_reduce_image_based_abuse)
- [SoK: Safer Digital-Safety Research Involving At-Risk Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00735)

### Cryptography and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

These are good places to learn about current and emerging cryptographic primitives and what they offer in an accessible way:

- [0xPARC's intro book](https://github.com/0xPARC/0xparc-intro-book)
- [0xPARC's notes site](https://notes.0xparc.org/)
- [0xPARC's Programmable Cryptography blog post](https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1)

For those interested in conducting research on multi-party fully homomorphic encryption (MP-FHE), here are a few papers to get started:

- [A 6-minute introduction to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)](https://www.zama.ai/introduction-to-homomorphic-encryption) (high-level functionality)
- [TFHE Deep Dive](https://www.zama.ai/introduction-to-homomorphic-encryption) (accessible intro to the mathematics)
- [Homomorphic Encryption from Learning with Errors: Conceptually-Simpler, Asymptotically-Faster, Attribute-Based](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/340.pdf) (doesn't explain bootstrapping needed computing circuits in FHE)
- [Efficient Fully Homomorphic Encryption from (Standard) LWE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/344.pdf) (explains dimension and modulus reduction needed for bootstrapping)
- [Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Ideal Lattices](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/hits09/gentry-homomorphic-encryption.pdf) (bootstrapping)

There are also technical tools that achieve privacy without cryptography, such as:

- [Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)](https://www.trustonic.com/technical-articles/what-is-a-trusted-execution-environment-tee/)

### Community Applications

- [Applications of MP-FHE for Vulnerable Communities](https://www.rileynwong.com/blog/2024/11/17/talk-applications-of-mp-fhe-for-vulnerable-communities)
- [Callisto: A Cryptographic Approach to Detecting Serial Perpetrators of Sexual Misconduct](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10061833)
- [Privacy Preserving Data Governance](https://ash.harvard.edu/resources/privacy-preserving-data-governance/)

### Guides: Privacy, Digital Safety and Self-Defense

- [Digital Defense Fund: Privacy Guides](https://digitaldefensefund.org/ddf-guides)
- [T4Tech: Digital Personas Zine, Doxxing Self Defense](https://t4tech-nyc.github.io/)
- [Zebra Crossing: Digital Safety Checklist](https://zebracrossing.narwhalacademy.org/)
- [EFF: Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/)
