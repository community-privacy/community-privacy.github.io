### Cryptography and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

#### Programmable Cryptography

A framework for applying cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge, multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, and more.

- [Programmable Cryptography (Part 1)](https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1)
- [Three Easy Pieces in Programmable Cryptography](https://github.com/0xPARC/0xparc-intro-book) - [Download (easy.pdf)](https://github.com/0xPARC/0xparc-intro-book/releases/)
