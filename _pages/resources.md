Our organizing team has compiled a non-exhaustive list of relevant resources. We hope these can be useful both for brainstorming project ideas as well as general learning.

### Co-Design
- [Design from the Margins: Centering the Most Marginalized and Impacted in Design Processes—from Ideation to Production](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/design-margins)
- [Introduction to community-led co-design](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/introduction/)
- [Community Co-Design Tools and Tactics: An approach to equitable community engagement and action](https://dmc.mn/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Community_CoDesign_Booklet.pdf)

### Community Needs

### Cryptography and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

#### Programmable Cryptography
- [0xPARC's intro book](https://github.com/0xPARC/0xparc-intro-book) - [Download (easy.pdf)](https://github.com/0xPARC/0xparc-intro-book/releases/)
- [0xPARC's notes site](https://notes.0xparc.org/)
- [0xPARC's Programmable Cryptography blog post](https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1)

#### Zero-knowledge (ZK):
