**A 2-4 week residency focused on researching, co-designing, prototyping, and building open-source applications for community privacy, with emphasis on Applications for Vulnerable Communities, Community Co-Design, and Privacy Infrastructure.**

As privacy-preserving applications mature beyond the infrastructure layer to reach end-users, it is crucial to anchor their design in the needs of real-world users. This residency brings together researchers, builders, and community members to explore user-centric methodologies like participatory design and participatory threat modelling, in conversation with the privacy needs of marginalised groups.

We invite community builders, engineers, designers, cryptographers, researchers, technologists, labor organizers, journalists, members of vulnerable communities, and advocates for digital safety, bodily autonomy, privacy, and more to join us.
