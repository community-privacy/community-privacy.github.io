**Contributors:**
Sora Suegami, Enrico Bottazzi, Pia Park

**Demo Day Video:**
WIP

**Support needed from residency/community:**

- Application ideas for indistinguishability obfuscation
- Engineering advice for speeding up lattice based cryptography
- Academic/research advice for iO construction design and its security proof
