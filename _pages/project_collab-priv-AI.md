**Project description:**  
Exploring how mutually distrusting parties can collaboratively and privately train AI models, with applications in community-driven, responsible, and privacy-preserving contexts.

**Artifacts:**

- Slides: [Collaborative and private AI model training to combat algorithmic bias](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zP25V5vyM7FF1PF_Icm9ROwQxvXLiFJ167KSj9SAmCk)
- [Github](https://github.com/yuriko627/vfl-demo)

**Contributors:**
Yuriko Nishijima, Val Elefante

**Demo day video public?:**
Yes — both mid-demo day (Yuriko: technical, Val: use case research) and the final one (Val: use case research)

**Support needed from residency/community:**

- Mentorship and expertise
- Connections to funding sources
- Help publicizing the work  
  Yuriko is looking for a funding resource to continue this research!

**Further comments:**

_**Yuriko:**_
_I’m an independent applied cryptography researcher with expertise in programmable cryptography (ZK, FHE, MPC, etc.) and Ethereum development. Currently, I’m exploring how cryptography and blockchain can support machine learning — not just for privacy protection, but to enable mutually distrusting parties to train models collaboratively with fair data contribution rewards (see: “data dignity”).

_**Val:**_  
_I am an independent researcher and project manager focused on community-led, responsible, public interest tech development. Like Yuriko, I’m excited about private and collaborative AI model training for mission- and community-driven orgs. Potential partners include CDFIs (credit unions and banks serving marginalized groups), social movement data co-ops, and artist collectives.
