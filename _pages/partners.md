## Organizing Team

Our organizing team consists of:

#### >> [Ying Tong Lai](https://github.com/therealyingtong) (she/her)

[Ying Tong](https://github.com/therealyingtong) is an applied cryptographer working on zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation. She is a regular contributor to community and educational initiatives (e.g. [zkiap.com](https://zkiap.com), [halo2.club](https://halo2.club)), as well as standards efforts ([zkproof.org](https://zkproof.org)).

#### >> [Riley Wong](https://www.emergentresearch.net/) (they/them)

Riley Wong (they/them) consults and conducts research as the principal of [Emergent Research](https://emergentresearch.net/), investigating privacy, governance, and data. In particular, they're exploring emerging privacy and cryptography tools with emphasis on applications for vulnerable communities and infrastructure for collective agency and consent.

Theyâ€™ve [written](https://ash.harvard.edu/resources/privacy-preserving-data-governance/) and [given talks](https://www.rileynwong.com/blog/2024/1/20/talk-privacy-preserving-data-governance-at-the-second-interdisciplinary-workshop-on-reimagining-democracy-iword-2023-harvard-kennedy-school-ash-center) on privacy-preserving data governance, [applications](https://www.emergentresearch.net/mpfhe-reporting) of [MP-FHE for vulnerable communities](https://www.rileynwong.com/blog/2024/11/17/talk-applications-of-mp-fhe-for-vulnerable-communities), [collective governance](https://www.rileynwong.com/blog/2024/3/11/talk-collective-governance-governance-archaeology), [consent mechanisms](https://www.emergentresearch.net/consent-interfaces), and more.

Previously, they were a research fellow with [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/), machine learning engineer at Google, investigative journalism fellow at ProPublica, and a QTBIPOC community organizer.

#### >> [Janabel Xia](https://www.janabelx.com/) (she/her)

Janabel Xia (she/her) is a mathematician working on researching and developing applications of privacy for communities.

Previously, she has worked with [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/) on research, building applications of ZKPs ([POD counting](https://github.com/janabel/frog-POD-counting), [private polling](https://github.com/zk-poll/zk-poll)), educational resources, and outreach. Prior to that, she has published academic research in both [combinatorics](https://ecajournal.haifa.ac.il/Volume2024/ECA2024_S2A23.pdf) and [theoretical cryptography](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/573.pdf) as an MIT undergrad.

She has also led community engagement programs out of the [MIT PKG Center for Public Service](https://pkgcenter.mit.edu/). Her experience there has led to her current involvement in [Justice 4 Housing](https://justice4housing.org/), a local grassroots organization tackling housing justice and re-entry support for the formerly incarcerated.
