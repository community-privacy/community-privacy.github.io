**Project description:**  
I wrote an essay exploring what the archiving tradition inherits from Western counterinsurgency efforts, and what lessons the profession can learn from cryptography during a modern era defined by informational warfare. (Originally framed as a workshop, it quickly became obvious that it didn’t make sense as a slide presentation at this stage of research.)

**Artifacts:**  
Coming soon, editing text!

**Contributors:**

**Demo day video public?:**
Does not apply.

**Support needed from residency/community:**  
I would love to stay in touch with both the organizers and residents <3 I’d really love a round of feedback on the essay from you guys before publishing.  
Hmmm, is there anyone you think I should talk to about this?

**Further comments:**  
_Still really curious about zk use cases for documentarianssss will be fussing around with this in the following months._
