title: Survey on Distributed Private Machine Learning for Interbank Mule Account Detection
nav: false
---

**Project description:**
Money mule accounts are frequently used in money laundering operations between Thai banks. These accounts serve as intermediaries to receive and forward fraudulent funds, making them difficult to trace once an interbank transfer is made. PII restrictions make crossbank fraud detection hard. The survey seeks to find initial approaches which might be viable.
