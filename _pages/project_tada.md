**Support requested from the community:**

- Iâ€™m looking for funding to continue building out the circuit library into functional applications! ðŸŽ‰
- Iâ€™d love for this work to be more visible (Iâ€™ve provided a 2-part hackmd writeup), and work with collaborators to see where TADA might be an interesting solution! ðŸŽ‰

**Further comments:**

- _Special thanks to Emma, Enrico, Zoey, and many others for conversations, as well as the Community Privacy Residency for creating the space for this project to come to life <3 ðŸŽ‰_
- _Find me on Telegram/Discord @topanisto, Twitter [@aka_topo](https://x.com/aka_topo), and ðŸ“§ ankaa [at] mit.edu for the next few months!_
- _Iâ€™m broadly interested in protocol design in applied cryptography and exploring using ZK to make more meaningful digital interactions._
