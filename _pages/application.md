## Application Guidance

In terms of roles, we see most people likely falling under one or more of the following:

- **Builder**: building technical applications and/or infrastructure, looking for general technical proficiency as well as in cryptography (zero-knowledge, multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, verifiable networks, etc.). Outputs may include technical prototypes; maintenance, such as making boilerplates, tutorials, technical documentation; proofs-of-concepts; educational workshops or materials, etc.
- **Community Organizer**: member of a community with privacy needs, looking for demonstrated leadership and advocacy in domains such as labor, journalism, whistleblowing, community organizing, etc. Outputs may include conducting participatory co-design sessions with their community and publishing reports, findings, learnings, etc.; compiling resource guides for their community in collaboration with our privacy experts; organizing public-facing workshops on relevant topics, etc.
- **Researcher**: including privacy and cryptography research (ZK, MPC, FHE, etc.) as well as community-focused research (social sciences, anthropology, participatory co-design, etc.). Outputs may include publishing research and writing (papers, blog posts, etc.), conducting participatory co-design sessions and documenting processes and findings, novel research of any form, technical writing; etc.
- **Designer**: including participatory and community co-design, UX researcher, interface design, etc. Outputs can include participatory co-design sessions, reports/findings/etc., mockups, publishing research and writing, conducting and publishing UX research, e.g. on privacy tools and interfaces

And to note, we hope for a lot of cross-collaboration and cross-education among our residents. These roles are meant to be descriptive, so even if---or perhaps especially if---your work falls outside of one of these categories, we would still love to hear from you.

In terms of what we select on, we want to prioritize:

- Expertise in a specific domain, e.g. privacy, cryptography, participatory co-design, UX design, community organizing, journalism, labor unions, or other relevant topics
- Culture and community, e.g. values collaboration, co-learning, open-source and public goods, curiosity, equity, inclusion
- For the holistic cohort: diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, proficiencies, skillsets, communities, cultures, locations, etc.; potential for long-term collaboration in the ecosystem; community impact

For a successful residency, we value both high quality collaborative outputs as well as longer-term relationship and community building.

## Frequently Asked Questions

_Do I need to be a cryptography expert to apply?_\
No, we are seeking domain experts in many areas, including design, governance, community organizing, journalism, labor, and many more. If you are a member of a vulnerable community or a community with privacy needs, we would love to hear from you.

_When can I expect to hear back?_\
We will be reviewing the days following the deadline and will send out decisions by 1/14.

_Will my travel and housing be covered?_\
We will cover travel and accommodations, and/or provide full or partial stipends, with priority for those with financial need.

_Can I work full-time and still do the residency?_\
We would prefer residents be able to show up with presence and to spend dedicated time and energy with our residency cohort. If you need to take time off to make this work, we will have a limited number of 2-week residency options available.

_Do I have to physically be present for the duration of the residency?_\
Yes, we value having residents share physical space for building community. We may find other ways for remote participation, such as through streaming talks or facilitating an online community, to be announced.

_What kinds of projects are you looking for?_\
We list a few example project ideas under each [project track](https://community-privacy.github.io/) for inspiration.
