## Application Guidance

In terms of roles, we see most people likely falling under one or more of the following:

- **Builder**: building technical applications and/or infrastructure, looking for general technical proficiency as well as in cryptography (zero-knowledge, multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, verifiable networks, etc.). Outputs may include technical prototypes; maintenance, such as making boilerplates, tutorials, technical documentation; proofs-of-concepts; educational workshops or materials, etc.
- **Community Organizer**: member of a community with privacy needs, looking for demonstrated leadership and advocacy in domains such as labor, journalism, whistleblowing, community organizing, etc. Outputs may include conducting participatory co-design sessions with their community and publishing reports, findings, learnings, etc.; compiling resource guides for their community in collaboration with our privacy experts; organizing public-facing workshops on relevant topics, etc.
- **Researcher**: including privacy and cryptography research (ZK, MPC, FHE, etc.) as well as community-focused research (social sciences, anthropology, participatory co-design, etc.). Outputs may include publishing research and writing (papers, blog posts, etc.), conducting participatory co-design sessions and documenting processes and findings, novel research of any form, technical writing; etc.
- **Designer**: including participatory and community co-design, UX researcher, interface design, etc. Outputs can include participatory co-design sessions, reports/findings/etc., mockups, publishing research and writing, conducting and publishing UX research, e.g. on privacy tools and interfaces

And to note, we hope for a lot of cross-collaboration and cross-education among our residents. These roles are meant to be descriptive, so even if---or perhaps especially if---your work falls outside of one of these categories, we would love to hear from you.

In terms of what we select on, we want to prioritize:

- Expertise in a specific domain, e.g. privacy, cryptography, participatory co-design, UX design, community organizing, journalism, labor unions, policy, or other relevant topics
- Culture and community, e.g. values of collaboration, co-learning, open-source and public goods, curiosity, equity, inclusion
- For the holistic cohort: diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, proficiencies, skillsets, communities, cultures, locations, etc.; potential for long-term collaboration in the ecosystem; community impact

For a successful residency, we value both high quality collaborative outputs as well as longer-term relationship and community building.
