As we start to plan for the next iteration, we look back as well to highlights from the past one:</p> <h2 id="rightscon-conference">RightsCon conference</h2> <p>We attended the four-day <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/program" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RightsCon</a> conference, focused on the intersection of human rights and technology, covering issues like counter-surveillance, free speech, and net neutrality. After each conference day, we held internal debrief and sharing sessions, and collectively contributed to notes on more than thirty sessions. Several of our residents also presented sessions at RightsCon, on topics including digital security training, algorithmic bias, and network security.</p> <p>We also attended various satellite events, including the <a href="https://g0v-jothon.kktix.cc/events/g0v-hackath65n" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">g0v hackathon</a>, and the <a href="https://www.accupass.com/event/2502060951431933743454" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Abortion Access and Internet Freedom side-event</a>.</p> <h2 id="community-events">Community events</h2> <p>We organised a post-RightsCon decompression event, featuring partners from <a href="https://a11ylab.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Accessibility Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.plurality.net" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Plurality</a>, and more.
